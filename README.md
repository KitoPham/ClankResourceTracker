# ClankResourceTracker

## Hi welcome to the source code of this app
This app currently uses a custom Dialog with Android architecture components of View Models and Live Data to provide
users with a way to easily keep count of their resources while playing the board game Clank!. 

This project is a way for me to experiment with various kinds of components or widgets and will be updated routinely as  I learn new things.
